            <h1>Bayesian Networks: Inference Goals</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Last time, we looked at the basic structure and semantics of Bayesian Networks: our window into the world of intuitive probabilistic inference!</p>
              <p>That said, let's not lose sight of our goals for how we hope to employ them:</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Probabilistic inference</strong> using Bayesian Networks accepts some query over network variables \(\alpha\), any observed evidence \(\beta\)
                and then returns the conditional distribution \(P(\alpha | \beta)\) (which includes non-conditional queries when \(\beta = \{\}\)). In notation similar to our propositional
                logic KB queries:
                $$BN.ask(\alpha, \beta) = P(\alpha | \beta)$$
              </p>
              <p>Being able to perform probabilistic queries on the network will then allow us (or our intelligent agent) to make decisions based on the results, just like good old
                Solicitorbot deciding whether or not to visit a house based on whether or not it believes someone to be home.</p>
              <p class='debug'>While we have been able to intuitively use BNs for some simple queries to be done by hand, we do not yet have this general inference procedure.</p>
              <p>Before we formalize it, however, we must make two observations about the extent of what we know:</p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>We do not want inference to consider information in the BN that is irrelevant to the query (i.e., independent of it).</p></li>
                <li><p>We currently lack an algorithm that will tell us if any two variables are independent (or conditionally independent) given another set.</p></li>
              </ol>
              <p>So, let's see if we can remedy item (2) above to facilitate item (1), and then move on to inference!</p>
            </div>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            
            
            <div id='dsep' class='scrollspy-element' scrollspy-title="d-Separation"></div>
            <h1>d-Separation</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Last class, the Solicitorbot example had a simple, 3 variable network, but we can imagine much larger networks with more variables and relationships between
                one another.</p>
              <p>As such, just as we intuited some independence relationships for that simple 3 variable network, we should have a more general rule to analyze networks of arbitrary
                size.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>You can consider a Bayesian Network as defining the channels through which information can flow between variables (like water).</p>
              <p>Each node can be viewed as a <strong>faucet</strong> that can either be:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>On / Open:</strong> information flows between variables (therefore, variables are dependent).</p>
                  <div class='text-center fit-pres'>
                    <img src='../../../assets/images/spring-2018/cmsi-485/week-8/d-sep-open.png' />
                  </div>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Off / Closed:</strong> information flow is blocked between variables (therefore, variables are independent).</p>
                  <div class='text-center fit-pres'>
                    <img src='../../../assets/images/spring-2018/cmsi-485/week-8/d-sep-closed.png' />
                  </div>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>What we need, therefore, are the rules for determining when a faucet is opened or closed.</p>
              <p>One of the beautiful things about Bayesian Networks is that we have precisely that formalization simply by looking at the directionality of edges in the graph!</p>
              <p class='definition'>The rules of <strong>directional-separation (d-separation)</strong> determine a Bayesian Network's independence and conditional independence
                claims directly from the network's structure.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h3>d-Separation: Path Analysis</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p class='definition'>Two variables \(A, B\) are independent given some other set of variables \(C\) if *all* <strong>undirected paths</strong> (any sequence of 
                nodes connected by edges, ignoring edge direction) between \(A, B\) are blocked.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The rules of d-separation decide if information can flow through triplets of nodes \(X, Y, Z\) along an undirected path with one node serving 
                as the "faucet."</p>
              <p>Since edges can only be directed 1 of 2 ways between 2 variables, we can analyze the independence rules of each configuration of edges between
                the triplet's variables to compose the foundations of d-separation.</p>
              <p>There are three such "rules" corresponding to each type of triplet:</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Rule 1: Forks \(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\)</h4>

              <p class='answer' name='ds-q0'>$$L \not \indep C$$ ...because whether or not a house's lights are on tells us something about whether or not someone is home, which in turn

              <p class='toolkit'>A fork \(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\) is blocked along a path if \(Z\) is given; i.e., if a <strong>common cause</strong> is given, a fork is
                blocked.</p>

              <h4>Rule 2: Chains \(X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y\) OR \(X \leftarrow Z \leftarrow Y\)</h4>
              <p>Suppose we've pivoted to the medical domain wherein MediBot 7000 must make some diagnoses based on observed symptoms.</p>
              <p>Suppose also that medicine has determined that the presence of tar in lungs causes lung cancer, which is deposited by smoking, giving us:</p>

              <p class='answer' name='ds-q4'>$$A \indep C$$ ...because they're independent coin flips! Knowing about one tells us nothing about the outcome of the other without any

              <p>...but that's not all!</p>
              <p>Consider that if the bell rings, our other inovation, Butlerbot 6000, brings us a cup of tea.</p>

              <p>As such, we have the now, complete rule for sinks:</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>A sink \(X \rightarrow Z \leftarrow Y\) is blocked along a path if <i>neither \(Z\) nor its descendants</i> are given.</p>
