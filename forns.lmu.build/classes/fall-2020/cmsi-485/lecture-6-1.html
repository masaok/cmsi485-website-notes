            <h1>Value of Perfect Information</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Today we look at a topic very closely related to Decision Networks and Utility Theory, and one that might feel vaguely related to a dilemma faced by an agent
                in a previous assignment...</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>In your BlindBot assignment, you may have taken moves that were not directly aimed at the goal, but instead at more safely navigating the environment
                and attempting to pinpoint previously ambiguous pit locations.</p>
              <p class='remark'>In taking these extra, exploratory moves, BlindBot still incurred some minor cost (that battery was draining quickly!), but that cost could be 
                offset if the investment helped navigate around a pit!</p>
              <p>This is true of many decision-making tasks: we're often willing to go a little bit out of our way to gather extra information if it means making a better decision
                overall.</p>
              <p>In other words, we might say that extra information has some *value* in terms of our utility function that our agent is still attempting to maximize.</p>
              <p>While some information may be worthwhile to take a detour to acquire, other info might not be, and we should equip our agent to answer the very important
                question:</p>
              <p><blockquote>"Is the juice worth the squeeze?"</blockquote></p>
              <p class='definition'>The <strong>Value of Perfect Information (VPI)</strong> computes the expected increase in utility from acquiring new evidence.</p>
              <p>We'll see why it's termed "Perfect" information in a moment, but for now, let's consider a motivating example (warning, I took a traditional example and
                spiced it up a little with some maximal cringe).</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='example'><strong>Music Festival Tickets</strong></p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>You are debating whether or not to buy tickets to the upcoming Fyre Music Festival, but tickets 
                  are expensive and you'll only really enjoy it if the line-up is lit (lyt?). Still, you get fear of missing out (FOMO) quite easily, and there would be near
                  irreparable social cost if you didn't attend (until the next music festival, at least).</p></li>
                <li><p>The problem: tickets are on presale and are going to sell out before the entire line-up is listed, but your favorite band has neither confirmed nor denied
                  their spot on the bill.</p></li>
                <li><p>Your friend's friend, Mike (who always just seems to be around social gatherings, but was never particularly invited), claims that he knows a member of your
                  favorite band, and will tell you whether or not they'll be there (thus making the line-up lyt)... if you give him $5 (the scumbag). You're not sold on Mike's
                  reputation and think there's a decent chance he's just bumming $5 for some White Claw.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Your Task:</strong> determine if it's worth it to give $5 to Mike.</p>
              <p class='question' name='vpi-q0'>Knowing what you know now, how might you go about answer this?</p>
              <div class='answer' name='vpi-q0'>
                <p>We'd need to define 3 things:</p>
                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p>The likelihood that Mike will give us an honest, accurate answer as to our favorite band's attendance.</p></li>
                  <li><p>How much we value attending / not attending the festival in all possible outcomes, i.e., our favorite band attending / not attending.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Oh hey, let's use a decision-network to do those things.</p>
              </div>
              <p class='toolkit'>Because computing VPI requires uniting probabilistic distributions and utility scores, it can be computed directly from a specified
                decision-network.</p>
              <p>For our example, suppose we come up with the following:</p>
              <div class='fit-pres text-center'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2019/cmsi-485/week-8/music-fest-dn.png' />
              </div>
              <p>Just *how* we came up with those likelihoods and utility values is a matter of debate (but if you were taking this example seriously, you're already doing it
                wrong).</p>
              <p>Still, let's suppose those utility values are mappable to monetary amounts, and we can compare whether or not Mike's info is worth the cost.</p>
              <p class='example'>Reflect: How do we go about that computing the value of Mike's information from the assumptions in our decision-network?</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Defining VPI</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>The proceduralization of computing VPI stems from a couple of intuitive insights:</p>
              <p class='remark'><strong>Insight 1:</strong> We will act optimally (i.e., according to the Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) criteria) with whatever information we 
                have available to us, \((E = e)\).</p>
              <p class='remark'><strong>Insight 2:</strong> We may act differently as soon as we acquire new information (about some other var \(E'\)).</p>
              <p class='question' name='vpi-q1'>How do we then combine these two insights to define VPI?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='vpi-q1'>VPI = difference in maximum expected utility between having and not having the new information!</p>
              <p>Formally, we can express that as:</p>
              <p class='definition'>Computing the VPI of observing some variable \(E'\) for any *already* observed evidence \(E = e\) is defined as the difference in maximum
                expected utility between knowing and not knowing the state of \(E'\), written:
                $$VPI(E' | E = e) = MEU(E = e, E') - MEU(E = e)$$
              </p>
              <div class='remark'>
                <p>In words, interpreting the above:</p>
                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p>\(VPI(E' | E = e)\) = The value of learning about the state of \(E'\) if I already know \(E = e\).</p></li>
                  <li><p>\(MEU(E = e, E')\) = The expected utility of me acting optimally knowing what I do now \(E=e\), AND about the state of \(E'\).</p></li>
                  <li><p>\(MEU(E = e)\) = The expected utility of me acting optimally knowing what I do now \(E=e\).</p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>This computation would be relatively straightforward were it not for a couple of snags:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>We have to assess how each value of the evaluated variable \(E'\) affects our decisions and the resulting utility (we might change our mind given
                  some new evidence).</p></li>
                <li><p>Since \(E'\) is still a random variable, we need to weight our final assessment according to the likelihood of seeing each value of \(E'=e'\) given our
                  already observed evidence \(E = e\).</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Let's step back from words and definitions and depict what's going on.</p>
              <p>We'll start by comparing the MEU of the case wherein we don't know anything about \(E'\) and the case where we know it to be observed at some value.</p>
              <p>Depicted below: a tree diagramming the MEU computation wherein triangles represent max-nodes (take the max value of their children), circles summation, and
                diamonds the utility map.</p>
              <div class='fit-pres text-center'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2019/cmsi-485/week-8/meu-depiction.png' />
              </div>
              <p class='example'>For our Music Festival example, the left represents our MEU if we didn't know anything going into it \(E = \emptyset\) whereas the right would
                be our MEU if Mike gave us any one answer to whether or not our favorite band was going to play, \(E' = e'\).</p>
              <p>Note: the only difference is a change in the likelihood of being in each state.</p>
              <p class='debug'>However, this right tree is not the whole story, because as noted, when considering the VPI of \(E'\), we have to think about its usefulness *contingent on the answer
                we get* for each of its states -- we don't know what answer we'll get in advance!</p>
              <p>Each of these possible states \(e' \in E'\) has some likelihood associated with it that must be updated by our observed evidence \(E = e\), meaning we must
                assess:</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>The Maximum Expected Utility associated with the reveal of some variable \(E'\) given some other evidence \(E = e\) is the weighted sum over all
                values \(e' \in E'\) of the likelihood of seeing \(e'\) with the MEU of how we would act seeing \(e'\), or formally:
                $$MEU(E = e, E') = \sum_{e' \in E'} P(E' = e' | E = e) MEU(E = e, E' = e')$$
              </p>
              <p>Again, depicting this scenario, we see we have our right-most tree above but replicated and weighted by the likelihood of seeing each value \(e' \in E'\):</p>
              <div class='fit-pres text-center'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2019/cmsi-485/week-8/meu-madness.png' />
              </div>
              <p>Whew! What a tree. That tree makes you smile, sit back in your chair, smile ponderously, put your chin on your hand and think, "Damn... I'm educated."</p>
              <p>Let's see how to actually do one of these examples by hand, hmm?</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Proceduralizing VPI</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>Returning to our Music Festival Example, let's go step by step trying the reason over the above.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Step One:</strong> Find \(MEU(E = e)\), i.e., MEU without knowing anything about \(E'\).</p>
              <p>In our example, this isn't too bad since \(E = \emptyset\)</p>
              <p class='well'>\begin{eqnarray}
                MEU(\emptyset) &=& max_a \sum_s P(s|a, e) U(s, a) \\
                               &=& max_t \sum_b P(B = b | T = t) U(B = b, T = t) \\
                               &=& max_t \sum_b P(B = b) U(B = b, T = t) \\
                         T = 0 &\Rightarrow& P(B = 0) U(B = 0, T = 0) + P(B = 1) U(B = 1, T = 0) \\
                               &=& 0.4 * 35 + 0.6 * 15 = 23 \\
                         T = 1 &\Rightarrow& P(B = 0) U(B = 0, T = 1) + P(B = 1) U(B = 1, T = 1) \\
                               &=& 0.4 * 20 + 0.6 * 40 = 32
              \end{eqnarray}</p>
              <p>Therefore, our \(MEU(\emptyset) = 32\), and it seems that buying a ticket for the show is the clear win.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Step Two:</strong> Find \(MEU(E = e, E' = e')~\forall~e' \in E'\), i.e., the MEU of how we would act knowing each possible outcome of the
                variable being evaluated: \(E'\).</p>
              <p class='question' name='vpi-q2'>In our Music Festival example, what is \(E'\), and what values do we have to assess?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='vpi-q2'>Our \(E'\) is Mike's Tip \(M\), and we must assess the MEU in each world where: (1) Mike tells us the band isn't playing, and
                (2) Mike tells us they are.</p>
              <p>This is slightly easier because we have no additional information going into the problem, i.e., no \(E = e\), but since Mike's Tip only tells us something
                about the utility through what it tells us about \(B\), we'd need to compute \(P(B | M)\) through standard inference. I've done that for us, to save some time:</p>
              <div class='fit-pres text-center'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2019/cmsi-485/week-8/updated-cpt.png' />
              </div>
              <p>With that knowledge in tow:</p>
              <p class='well'>\begin{eqnarray}
                MEU(M = 0) &=& max_t \sum_b P(B = b | M = 0) U(B = b, T = t) \\
                     T = 0 &\Rightarrow& P(B = 0 | M = 0) U(B = 0, T = 0) + P(B = 1 | M = 0) U(B = 1, T = 0) \\
                           &=& 0.64 * 35 + 0.36 * 15 \approx 28 \\

            <h1>VPI Properties</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Now for the exciting part that everyone eagerly awaits: some properties of VPI!</p>
              <p>First, motivated by a question that has also plagued philosophers for ages...</p>
              <p class='question' name='props-q0'>Is it ever possible for additional knowledge to be *harmful* to expected utility? i.e., could we have:
                $$MEU(E = e, E') \stackrel{?}{\lt} MEU(E = e)$$
              </p>
              <p class='answer' name='props-q0'>Yes! Learning the value of some variable might make all of our decisions (under either of its values)
                look more grim than had we not known about it to begin with.</p>
              <p class='question' name='props-q0.1'>This would, however, make \(VPI(E' | E = e) \lt 0\) -- why does this not make sense?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='props-q0.1'>Information is only ever helpful (in that it helps to narrow down the possible state we're in), or useless, but 
                never harmful, by definition, because we could always just ignore that information and be as well off as we were before seeing it.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Property 1:</strong> VPI is <strong>nonnegative</strong> such that:
                $$VPI(E' | E = e) \ge 0~\forall~E', e$$
              </p>
              <p class='toolkit'>Functionally, this means that any VPI computation whose difference between \(MEU(E=e, E')\) and \(MEU(E=e)\) is negative
                is simply capped at 0.</p>
              <p>Knowledge is power!</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>This raises an interesting question, since we said it can be greater than *or equal to* 0.</p>
              <p class='question' name='props-q1'>Under what circumstances might \(VPI(E' | E = e) = 0\)?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='props-q1'>When the evidence is irrelevant to the utility!</p>
              <p>Generally, since a decision network still obeys the rules of d-separation, we can simply determine whether or not the variable being assessed tells us anything
                new about the utility node.</p>
              <div class='toolkit'><p><strong>Property 2:</strong> The VPI of variables that are independent / conditionally independent from the utility node(s) will be 0, viz.:
                  $$(E' \indep U | E = e) \Rightarrow VPI(E' | E = e) = 0$$
                </p>
                <p>(where \((E' \indep U | E = e)\) is used to indicate that \(dsep(E', U | E = e)\))</p>
              </div>
              <p class='example'>Suppose we added another variable related to Mike's Tip in our Music Festival Example, some variable \(A\):</p>

              <div class='question' name='props-q2'>
                <p>Are each of the following VPI queries zero or nonzero?</p>

                </ol>
              </div>
              <div class='answer' name='props-q2'>
                <p>Answers:</p>
                <ol class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p>\(VPI(A)\) = 0 since \(A \indep U\)</p></li>

              <br/>
              
              <p>Lastly, consider the fact that we might be interested in / offered the values of *two or more* variables like:</p>
              <p>$$VPI(E'_i, E'_j | E = e)$$</p>
              <p>This is indeed allowed, but we should be careful with how we compute the value of having multiple new pieces of evidence. To see where this danger comes from:</p>
              <p class='question' name='props-q3'>Is \(VPI\) additive such that, for any arbitrary \(E'_j, E'_k\):
                $$VPI(E'_j, E'_k | E = e) \stackrel{?}{=} VPI(E'_j | E = e) + VPI(E'_k | E = e)$$
              </p>
              <p class='answer' name='props-q3'>No! This might give us overlapping value.</p>
              <p>Consider having \(VPI(M, B)\) in our previous example, in which \(M\) provides no new value that \(B\) doesn't already, but alone, each does have a positive VPI.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Property 3:</strong> VPI is <strong>non-additive</strong> such that:
                $$VPI(E'_j, E'_k | E = e) \ne VPI(E'_j | E = e) + VPI(E'_k | E = e)$$
              </p>
              <p>(Note: although not true in general, this *might* be the case for some circumstances... can you think of what they are?)</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>However, not all hope is lost, since we can still compute the VPI on multiple query variables so long as we isolate the *portion* of utility that each query
                can provide information about.</p>
              <p>Intuitively, this can be done by holding one of the two variables constant (i.e., as observed evidence) while computing the VPI of the other.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Property 4:</strong> VPI is <strong>order independent</strong> for computing the value of multiple queries so long as the others are held
                constant after their contribution to the utility has been evaluated (and the order doesn't matter):
                \begin{eqnarray}
                  VPI(E'_j, E'_k | E = e) &=& VPI(E'_j | E = e) + VPI(E'_k | E'_j, E = e) \\
                                          &=& VPI(E'_k | E = e) + VPI(E'_j | E'_k, E = e) \\  
                \end{eqnarray}
              </p>
              <p class='remark'>Think of this relationship as the "Conditioning" rule of VPI (it even looks a lot like it).</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>Whew! At this point you might be questioning the value of information in general -- too much can be enriching or crushing!</p>
              <p>We'll chase this lecture with some practice next time around... see y'all at the Fyre Festival, I've heard good things from Mike.</p>
