            <h1>Classwork 1</h1>
            <div>
              <p>This classwork will give you some practice with the theory behind propositional logic inference, as well as some practice with
                theorem proving.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Problem 1</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>Provide a short (at max, a paragraph) answer to each of the following questions.</p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>One of the most common mistakes with propositional logic inference is to assume that resolution is defined on multiple propositions at a time. 
                  Prove, using the definition of <strong>propositional logic entailment</strong>, that this is not the case; specifically (for props. \(X,Y,Z\)) show that:
                  $$(X \lor Y \lor Z) \land (\lnot Y \lor \lnot Z) \not \vDash (X)$$</p></li>
                <li><p>Certain logic systems exploit Knowledge Bases with only Horn Clauses, which are clauses with at *most* one positive (i.e., non-negated) literal / proposition.
                  For instance, \(\lnot P \lor Q \lor \lnot R\) is a Horn Clause (since \(Q\) is the only positive literal) whereas \(\lnot P \lor Q \lor R\) is not (more than one
                  positive literal). Why might having Horn Clauses prove useful / beneficial for resolution-based inference engines?</p></li>
              </ol>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Problem 2</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>One of the early applications of propositional logic was an attempt to allow machines to comprehend stories / corpi of text and then
                answer questions about them (its successor, first-order logic attempted to do the same at a higher level of abstraction).</p>
              <p>This strategy would ultimately, as with many other similar endeavors, fail to scale, but is interesting to consider in practice, especially as a companion
                to more modern statistical techniques.</p>
              <p>Many smaller-scale systems can still effectively use these strategies, and are sometimes still found in practice, as with sophisticated Q&amp;A
                systems to automate customer service.</p>
              <p class='definition'>Consider the following story (written from the perspective of the future, per my upcoming novel)
                with bracketed propositions \([P]\), use its rules and facts to formalize a KB in CNF, and then answer some 
                inference queries that follow.</p>
              <p>
                Preceding the Great Forneybot Uprising of 2024, the world was in a utopic state of bliss with humankind finally served by throngs of our
                robotic servants. Forney Industries, sadly, had a number of fatal oversights in their robots' design, any number of whose small,
                environmental quirks could cause them to violently malfunction. Before the flaws were discovered, it was, of course, too late (science demands progress!) --
                however, it has long been a matter of historical discourse for what event actually triggered the first mass malfunction...
              </p>
              <p>Rules and facts:</p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Forneybots were found to malfunction \([M]\) if and only if they suffer water damage \([D]\) or overheard a logical paradox \([P]\).</p></li>
                <li><p>Forneybots may have been caught in a sudden rainstorm \([R]\), which are known to happen only during Winter \([W]\) or Summer \([S]\),
                  though not all Winters and Summers had rain.</p></li>
                <li><p>It also goes without saying that if it is one season, it cannot simultaneously be the others (in this dystopian future, Spring is no longer
                  a season, so don't worry about it).</p></li>
                <li><p>Moreover, rainstorms and water damage would have gone hand in hand, since the Forneybots were not aware of 
                  their weakness (note: "hand-in-hand" is usually... shorthand [puts sunglasses on] for bidirectional implication).</p></li>
                <li><p>Logical paradoxes, on the other hand, would have <i>only</i> been heard during election season (through TV or radio broadcast),
                  which are held in the Fall \([F]\) (and thus, all Fall seasons came hand in hand with paradoxes).</p></li>
                <li><p>The Great Forneybot Uprising occurred from a mass malfunction on Nov. 16, 2024 (note the season).</p></li>
              </ol>
              <div class='definition'>
                <p>Your task is as follows:</p>
                <ol class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p>Create a KB by converting each of the above English sentences into a propositional logic one.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Convert the KB into CNF, and enumerate each clause.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Using the above, we must settle the debate by showing that one of the following queries is true: (1) \(\alpha = \lnot D \land P\)
                    (i.e., that it was an overheard paradox and NOT water damage that caused the uprising) or (2) \(\beta = \lnot P \land D\) (vice versa).</p></li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <p class='debug'>For the inference step 3 above, show which clauses contributed to each inferred term on the way to a solution using resolution
