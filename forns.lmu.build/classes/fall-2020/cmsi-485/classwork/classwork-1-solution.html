              <hr/>
              <p>Provide a 1-2 sentence answer to each of the following questions.</p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>One of the most common mistakes with propositional logic inference is to assume that resolution is defined on multiple propositions at a time. 
                  Prove, using the definition of <strong>propositional logic entailment</strong>, that this is not the case; specifically (for props. \(X,Y,Z\)) show that:
                  $$(X \lor Y \lor Z) \land (\lnot Y \lor \lnot Z) \not \vDash (X)$$</p>
                  <div class='alert alert-success'>
                    <p>Firstly, let's be clear about the formal definition of entailment:
                      $$\alpha \vDash \beta \Leftrightarrow M(\alpha) \subseteq M(\beta)$$
                    </p>
                    <p>Concretely, this means that if there is ever a world in which \(\alpha = True\) but \(\beta = False\), then the above does not hold, and we can claim that
                      \(\alpha\) does *not* entail \(\beta\).</p>
                    <p>Now, in our example, let \(\alpha = (X \lor Y \lor Z) \land (\lnot Y \lor \lnot Z)\) and \(\beta = X\). Observe, that the world in which 
                      \(X = False, Y = True, Z = False\) is a model of \(\alpha\), but not for \(\beta\). Thus, we've proven that \((X \lor Y \lor Z) \land (\lnot Y \lor \lnot Z) \not \vDash (X)\).</p>
                  </div>
                  <p class='debug'>NOTE: ALL CAPS WARNING! THIS MEANS RESOLVING (for example) \(X \lor Y\) and \(\lnot X \lor \lnot Y\) IS NOT A CONTRADICTION, BUT RATHER, IS A VACUOUS
                    CLAUSE EQUAL TO THE BOOLEAN LITERAL True.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Certain logic systems exploit Knowledge Bases with only Horn Clauses, which are clauses with at *most* one positive (i.e., non-negated) literal / proposition.
                  For instance, \(\lnot P \lor Q \lor \lnot R\) is a Horn Clause (since \(Q\) is the only positive literal) whereas \(\lnot P \lor Q \lor R\) is not (more than one
                  positive literal). Why might having Horn Clauses prove useful / beneficial for resolution-based inference engines?</p>
                  <p class='alert alert-success'>Horn Clauses are <strong>computationally desirable</strong> as a filtering mechanism for which clauses are resolvable against one another. If we
                    represent any arbitrary clause as a set of propositions, finding one prop that is positive in one clause and also negated in the other is an \(O(n)\) operation 
                    (for \(n\) props); Horn Clauses, on the other hand, will only be resolvable with other Horn Clauses if (1) one has a positive prop and the other doesn't, and (2) 
                    if one has a positive prop, it is simply an \(O(1)\) operation to check if it is negated in the other. Other nice properties of Horn Clauses: (1) resolving any two Horn
                    clauses (that are amenable to resolution) will yield another Horn clause, and (2) the 0/1-positive literal property can be exploting as an indexing schema to make finding
                    clauses that resolve computationally attractive.</p>

              <h3>Problem 2</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p>One of the early applications of propositional logic was an attempt to allow machines to comprehend stories / corpi of text and then
                answer questions about them (its successor, first-order logic attempted to do the same at a higher level of abstraction).</p>
              <p>This strategy would ultimately, as with many other similar endeavors, fail to scale, but is interesting to consider in practice.</p>
              <p>Many smaller-scale systems can still effectively use these strategies, and are sometimes still found in practice, as with simple Q&amp;A
                systems to automate customer service.</p>
              <p class='definition'>Consider the following story (written from the perspective of the future, per my upcoming novel)
                with bracketed propositions \([P]\), and then use its rules and facts to formalize a KB and then answer some

              <p>
                Preceding the Great Forneybot Uprising of 2024, the world was in a utopic state of bliss with humankind finally served by throngs of our
                robotic servants. Forney Industries, sadly, had a number of fatal oversights in their robots' design, any number of whose small,
                environmental quirks could cause them to violently malfunction. Before the flaws were discovered, it was, of course, too late --
                however, it has long been a matter of historical discourse for what event actually triggered the first mass malfunction...

              <p class='alert alert-success'>Steps 1 and 2 of the requirements that follow are listed below each item.</p>

                $$KB14 = D \lor \lnot P$$
                Now, to inference!
                $$\begin{eqnarray}
                  [9, 13] \vDash KB15 &=& \lnot S \\
                  [10, 13] \vDash KB16 &=& \lnot W \\
                  [4, 15] \vDash KB17 &=& \lnot R \lor W \\
                  [4, 16] \vDash KB18 &=& \lnot R \\
                  [6, 18] \vDash KB19 &=& \lnot D \\
                  [8, 13] \vDash KB20 &=& P \\
                  [14, 19] \vDash KB21 &=& \lnot P \\
                  [20, 21] \vDash KB22 &=& \emptyset \\
                  \rightarrow \leftarrow
                \end{eqnarray}$$
                We have reached a contradiction, therefore, \(KB \vDash \lnot D \land P\). Since this is the case, it is trivial to show that our other hypothesis, (2) \(\beta = \lnot P \land D\)
                is NOT entailed by the KB.
              </p>
              <p class='toolkit'>Resolution Heuristic: since a contradiction is only reachable by resolving 2 atomic clauses (i.e., clauses with single propositions), and if one
                exists, it will be because of the addition of the negation of the query, it's usually best to focus on smaller clauses and those that contain propositions in the
                query before others.</p>
