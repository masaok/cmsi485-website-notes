              <p>Before we get started, some things to note about these course notes and the site you're currently viewing:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>You can add notes inside the website so that you can follow along and type as I say stuff! Just hit SHIFT + N and then click on a paragraph to add an editable note area below. 
                  NOTE: the notes you add will not persist if you close your browser, so make sure you save it to PDF when you're done taking notes! (see below) Having said that, know that there is a lot of
                  research that suggests taking hand-written notes to be far more effective at memory retention than typing them.</p></li>
                <li><p>The site has been optimized for printing, which includes the notes that you add, above. I've added a print button to the bottom of the site, but really it just calls your 
                  printer functionality, which typically includes an option to export to PDF.</p></li>
                <li><p>The coursenotes listed herein will have much of the lecture content, but not all of it; you are responsible for knowing the material you missed if you are absent from a lecture.</p></li>

            <div id='about' class='scrollspy-element' scrollspy-title='What is AI?'></div>
            <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Before we can answer what <i>artificial</i> intelligence is, let's start with an easy question:</p>
              <p class='example'>What properties, qualities, or behaviors do you associate with "intelligence?"</p>
              <p>There are many, many definitions of intelligence, and many of which will vary wildly depending on who you ask... here are a couple of good ones:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Pei Wang says, "The essence of intelligence is the principle of adapting to the environment while working with insufficient knowledge and resources. Accordingly, 
                  an intelligent system should rely on finite processing capacity, work in real time, open to unexpected tasks, and learn from experience. This working 
                  definition interprets "intelligence" as a form of "relative rationality."</p></li>
                <li><p>Legg and Hutter define intelligence as a measure for "an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."</p></li>
                <li><p>There are too many to list here; <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3329.pdf' target='_blank'>take a look at this paper for great reference.</a></p></li>
              </ul>
              <p class='example'>Give some examples of intelligent human behavior, and reflect: why might these be difficult to accomplish algorithmically?</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>Indeed, one of the hallmarks of intelligence is the ability to be <i>dynamic</i> with one's skillset: to apply an approach or strategy to many different
                looking situations.</p>
              <p>So, naturally, this class focuses on how we can formalize and apply this dynamism, which we usually ascribe to human reasoning (the gold standard of general intelligence
                at the time of this writing) to machines.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> is the theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks normally reserved for human-level
                intellects.</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong> is the theoretical pinacle of AI in which a single agent can perform *any* task given to it at
                human level or beyond.</p>
              <p class='debug'>There is debate in both the AI and Neuroscientific community as to whether or not "general" intelligence even exists in humans or if it can be
                replicated through a single model.</p>
              <p class='definition'>So, in the meantime, we in the AI community work from the ground-up, developing modular, <strong>specific intelligences</strong> that can equal or surpass humans
                on specific tasks.</p>
              <p>It turns out that much of these specific intelligences mirror facets of psychological study, so this class will also reference how the two fields share a lot in common.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Examples</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p class='example'>For each of the following links and examples, identify and discuss the human-analogous facets of intelligence that might be required to achieve the
                agent's specific task.</p>
              <div class='example'><p>Google's Deep Mind learning to walk:</p><br/>

              </div>
              <div class='example'><p>Google's Virtual Assistant Makes an Appointment:</p><br/>
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvbHu_bVa_g" target="_blank" class="assignment">Making a Hair Appointment</a>
              </div>
              <div class='example'><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Paint</p><br/>

              </div>
              <br/>
              
              <p>Getting any of the above to work is much easier said than done, of course!</p>
              <p>As it turns out, designing artificial intelligences is no walk in the park, and we have yet to skirt anywhere near the cohesive level of intelligence that humans
                achieve in their lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Some of the many challenges addressed in arbitrary AI tasks include:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>How to represent the knowledge of a reasoning system</p></li>
                <li><p>How to model its environment or the system in which it's reasoning.</p></li>
                <li><p>How to establish goals for a reasoning system, and the actions or steps it must take to accomplish those goals.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              
              <p>Plainly, these are high-level abstractions for much of what must be considered in any arbitrary AI application, which will vary wildly in complexity and approach.</p>
              <p>In fact, intelligence is such a complex confluence of systems that the current field of AI has decomposed into separate sub-disciplines, each devoted to developing
                the theories and applications relevant to a particular facet of intelligence, like natural language processing and vision.</p>

              <p>...plus many others, like creativity and the mother-of-all pursuits, artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>
              <p class='definition'>Note: these are major individual areas of focus in AI, but all tend to overlap in at least some points, as we will see in the coming months.</p>
              <p>So, with all of these exciting topics above, we should take a moment to make a meta-analysis of just what this class is, and what this class is not.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>What This Class <strong>IS</strong></h4>
              <hr/>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Coverage:</strong> This class will be a survey of almost all of the above disciplines (with the exception of NLP and RL), as well as the theories and algorithms
                that address many of their common problems.</p>
              <p>More specialized AI courses will give proper treatments to some of the more specialized areas of research.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>History:</strong> The role of this course will be to provide both a historical and practical perspective for many of the different subfields of AI, the problems they
                address, the theories they entail, and the work they have yet to do.</p>
              <p>It's important to understand not just where we are in the field, but where we've come. This will give you a deeper understanding of how we've acted as toolmakers, scientists, and explorers,
                giving you direction to advance the frontier in a similar fashion.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'><strong>Practice Meets Theory:</strong> This class does not just prepare you as practitioners of AI and ML, but theorists; you will understand the mathematics and motivations
                behind the tools, craft some of them by hand, but also learn to use popular toolkits that address a wide swath of real world problem.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>What This Class <strong>IS NOT</strong></h4>

                and Machine Learning more about how those agents' policies can be acquired or how humans gain insight from some data.</p>
              <p>This course looks at BOTH AI as a wholistic discipline and Machine Learning as an important substrata of that.</p>
              <p>There are other courses at LMU that are devoted only to Machine Learning and Data Science, for which this class will well-equip you.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='debug'><strong>Not Just Deep Learning:</strong> This class is *not* a focus on deep learning and its applications (though LMU does offer courses in this).</p>
              <p>Deep Learning has made a meteoric rise in both the AI culture and news, but has only warranted a couple weeks in our class; why?</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Deep learning is a sledgehammer solution to many interesting problems: just because you *can* apply it, doesn't mean there isn't a simpler, less cumbersome
                  solution to a task.</p></li>
                <li><p>Deep learning is laden with additional requirements: most require huge data-sets, large amount of learning or processing, and can involve complex decompositions
                  of learning environments to operate properly -- many such requirements are not always available.</p></li>
                <li><p>Deep learning is weak on interpretability: when something goes wrong, it's extremely difficult to say what... and when something goes right, it's sometimes
                  difficult to say why!</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>As such, although deep learning is a valuable tool in the AI practitioner's arsenal, it is not the sole focus of this class, and may be yet another of the many
                stepping stones that our discipline takes on the road to truly understanding (and then implementing!) intelligence.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='debug'><strong>Little Philosophy:</strong> This class will *not* prominently feature philosophical perspectives on AI.</p>
              <p>We may happen to discuss the myriad of fascinating philosophical problems surrounding AI, but only briefly or in passing; this is a technical CS course.</p>
              <p>This layer of discussion is better accomplished once you've learned some of the history and current tools in AI, and will feature prominently in the follow-on course,
                Cognitive Systems Design.</p>

            <h1>Designing Artificial Agents</h1>
            <div>
              <p>For the bulk of this course's beginning, we will investigate the theory and algorithms used in design of artificial agents, so we should take a moment to discuss some definitions.</p>
              <p class='question' name='ai-q2'>What does it mean to be an agent?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='ai-q2'>An agent is an entity that is imbued with... well... <i>agency</i>, i.e., the ability to make decisions and act autonomously in their environment.</p>
              <p class='definition'>An <strong>artificial agent</strong> is therefore one that we, as programmers, imbue with agency, mapping their observed environment (as through
                <i>sensors</i>) to some behavior.</p>
              <p>Just how we define the agent's capacities and model its environment will be a major focus throughout the course, and will differ depending upon the problems we're
                addressing.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>So what, precisely, constitutes an agent's reasoning environment?</p>
              <p class='definition'>An artificial agent's reasoning <strong>environment</strong> consists of all objects, features, actors, and possibly other agents that shall influence
                the agent's decisions.</p>
              <p class='example'>Suppose we are designing an artificial agent to play Pacman, as in the traditional game pictured below:</p>
              <div class='text-center fit-pres'>
                <img src='../../../assets/images/fall-2019/cmsi-485/week-1/pacman.jpg' width='60%' height='60%' />
              </div>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='question' name='ai-q3'>What kinds of <strong>features</strong>, i.e., parts of the environment that an agent attends to in its decision-making, do you think would be
                important in the Pacman environment?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='ai-q3'>The pellets, power pellets, fruits, ghosts, etc.</p>
              <p>As such, for each problem we address in this course, we will make assumptions and restrictions about the environment, and then craft an agent that addresses those modeling choices.</p>

            <div id='python' class='scrollspy-element' scrollspy-title='Python'></div>
            <h1>Python</h1>
            <div>
              <p class='definition'>In this course, we will be using the Python programming language for our programmatic assignments.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Why Python?</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>Python has become the outlet of choice for most AI and ML developers. Why?</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Easy to learn, easy to share:</strong> Python has one of the best packet management systems of any programming language, and as such, finding and distributing packages
                  that are relevant for your project can be a breeze. If you're not familiar using <code>pip</code> or <code>Anaconda</code> for package management, you'll soon learn why!</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Simple Data Processing:</strong> since many AI / ML applications must parse thousands of data points, often dancing around the dataset, Python boasts a number of
                  mechanisms that make data handling easy for the programmer.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>A Glue Language:</strong> Python is often referred to as a "glue" language, as it is capable of concerting applications written in other languages as well.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Some of its downsides are speed / efficiency (being a high-level language farther from the hardware, at which point languages like C++ are preferred), but ease and simplicity are
                often paramount with the complexity of endeavors in AI.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Need a Refresher?</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>Because of its ease, and the expectation that you'll be taking this class as of junior or senior standing, you've likely already seen Python, are learning it concurrently, or need
                a refresher.</p>
              <p class='toolkit'>Your level of Python expertise should match that covered by the following tutorial; run through this and let me know if you have any questions!</p>
              <p class='assignment'><a href='https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su19/project0/#python-basics' target='_blank'>Python Tutorial</a></p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='debug'>Warning: Parts of this class may involve Python version 2.7, others 3.X, but each assignment will specify which is required or expected.</p>
              <p>For your own configuration, you should be comfortable setting up environments that can execute Python scripts in either version seemlessly (see the tutorial above).</p>
