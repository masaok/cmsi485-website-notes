            <h1>Utility Theory</h1>
            <div>
              <p>So we've seen some probability theory, we've seen some Bayesian stuff, we've more or less hinted at how probabilistic queries can be useful for intelligent agents,
                but now we should formalize it!</p>
              <p>In today's lecture, we'll see how autonomous systems can use probabilistic reasoning in pursuit of improved decision-making.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Motivation</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p class='question' name='ut-q0'>Consider some way for an agent to decide how <strong>desirable</strong> a given state is (Hint: some inspiration may be gleaned from
                adversarial search from 282).</p>
              <p class='answer' name='ut-q0'>Some <strong>Utility Function / Score</strong> that assigned a numerical value to how good a state is -- the higher the better, baby!</p>
              <p>We can use this formalization to guide an agent's actions even under uncertain conditions; as a reminder:</p>
              <p class='definition'>A <strong>Utility Function</strong>, \(U(s) = u\), maps some state \(s\) to some numerical score \(u\) encoding its desirability.</p>
              <p class='example'>Give some examples of some utility scores for a variety of life events.</p>
              <p>Some examples might include:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>\(U(s) = 10,000,000\) for \(s =\) winning a $10,000,001 lottery ($1 ticket).</p></li>
                <li><p>\(U(s) = -1\) for \(s =\) buying a $1 ticket for, but losing, the lottery.</p></li>
                <li><p>...</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p class='toolkit'>Utility scores can be either hand-coded in a top-down fashion, or learned in a bottom-up.</p>
              <p>However, unlike in adversarial search wherein our agent's actions transformed the state in a certain fashion, sometimes we need to make the best decision we can
                under circumstances that are not completely under our control.</p>
              <p>Winning the lotter is great! ...but it's extremely rare.</p>
              <div class='example'>
                <p><strong>Decision-making under uncertainty</strong> crops up in a myriad of AI applications:</p>
                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p>In Blackjack, sometimes the best move is to hit even when we have a 15, even though sometimes we will bust.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In Hearthstone, sometimes the best move is to play a card that relies on some random number generator, even though sometimes it will backfire.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In Online Advertising, we must choose the ad that most likely fits a user's profile, even though clickthroughs are somewhat rare.</p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>As such, we need a formalization that marries the likelihood of some events happening with the desirability of those events.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Utility Theory</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p>Utility theory comes in handy when our agent must still attempt to act optimally even when its actions may have uncertain outcomes.</p>
              <p>We should be wary to weight the really good outcomes proportional to their likelihood of happening, and perhaps instead settle for a lesser good that is more likely
                to happen.</p>
              <p class='question' name='ref-q0'>Given the development of some Utility Function, and the notion of each state having some *chance* of occurring, can we devise some
                means of combining the two for informing a deciding agent?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='ref-q0'>We should be able to come up with a <strong>weighted</strong> utility score where the utility of each state is weighted by its likelihood
                of occurring!</p>
              <p>These considerations are filed under the heading of *expected* utility:</p>
              <div class='definition'>
                <p>The <strong>Expected Utility (EU)</strong> of some action \(a\) given any evidence \(e\) is the average utility value of the possible outcome states \(s \in S\)
                  weighted by the probability that each outcome occurs, or formally:
                  $$EU(a | e) = \sum_{s \in S} P(s | a, e) * U(s)$$
                </p>
              </div>
              <p class='question' name='ut-q1'>Plainly, then, if we're considering between some number of actions \(a \in A\) with uncertain outcomes, which action should we choose?</p>
              <p class='answer' name='ut-q1'>The one that maximizes the expected utility, of course!</p>
              <p>Wasn't it The Rolling Stones who said, "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might find... maximizing your expected utility 
                to be sufficient?"</p>
              <p class='definition'>The <strong>Maximum Expected Utility (MEU)</strong> criterion stipulates that an agent faced with \(a \in A\) actions with uncertain outcomes
                (and any observed evidence \(e\) shall choose the action \(a^*\) that maximizes the Expected Utility, or formally:
                $$MEU(e) = max_{a \in A} EU(a | e)$$
                $$a^* = \argmax_{a \in A} EU(a | e)$$
              </p>
              <p>Let's do an example, shall we?</p>

              <p class='answer' name='ut-q2'>
                We compute the EU for each action, then simply maximize!
                \begin{eqnarray}
                  EU(R = A) &=& P(T = 0 | R = A) * U(T = 0, R = A) + P(T = 1 | R = A) * U(T = 1, R = A)\\
                            &=& P(T = 0) * U(T = 0, R = A) + P(T = 1) * U(T = 1, R = A)\\
                            &=& 0.4 * (-20) + 0.6 * (-30)\\
                            &=& -26 
                \end{eqnarray}
                And again for the other route:
                \begin{eqnarray}
                  EU(R = B) &=& P(T = 0 | R = B) * U(T = 0, R = B) + P(T = 1 | R = B) * U(T = 1, R = B)\\
                            &=& P(T = 0) * U(T = 0, R = B) + P(T = 1) * U(T = 1, R = B)\\
                            &=& 0.4 * (-10) + 0.6 * (-40)\\
                            &=& -28
                \end{eqnarray}
                So, by the MEU criteria, looks like we choose Route A!

              <p class='example'>Repeat the above if we know, from user reports, that traffic is currently light \(T = 0\).</p>
              <p class='remark'>Note that, above, we were able to simplify the likelihoods of the action's effect on the context given that \(R \indep T\), but
                this might not always be the case! We'll need a model to help us determine the more complex relations.</p>

            <h1>Decision Networks</h1>
            <div>
              <p>The simple example in the previous section gives us a taste for the value of utility theory, but plainly, whenever we see some expressions of probability in the mix,
                we know that's just the tip of what could be a very large iceberg.</p>
              <p>Indeed, when utilities are based on nontrivial relationships of cause and effect between variables in the system (sometimes through relationships that our agent
                cannot control), our agent should have a means of modeling these relationships to best inform its decision-making.</p>
              <p>Naturally, then, pairing Bayesian Networks with Utility Theory seems like a nice way to enable autonomous, probabilistic reasoning.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Basics</h4>
              <hr/>
              <div class='definition'>
                <p>A <strong>decision network</strong> unifies the stochastic modelling capacities of a Bayesian network with action-choice and utility theory 
                  by adding two additional nodes to the Bayesian network model. In particular, decision networks specify:</p>
                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p><strong>Chance Nodes (Circles)</strong> are traditional Bayesian Network variable nodes encoding chance in CPTs.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Decision Nodes (Rectangles)</strong> represent choices that the agent has to make, and can be used to model influences on the system. In certain contexts,
                    decision nodes are referred to as <strong>interventions</strong>.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Utility Nodes (Diamonds)</strong> encode utility functions, wherein parents \(pa\) of utility nodes are the arguments to the utility function, \(U(pa)\).
                  </p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>Decision networks are useful for modeling complex probabilistic relationships between variables in the system while still attempting to maximize the utility of some
                decision that need be made.</p>
              <p>Note that the CPTs of chance nodes will treat decision nodes as parents like any other cause-effect relationship in a Bayesian Network, even though decision nodes
                have no attached CPT since they are intentional actions being chosen with some certainty by the agent.</p>
              <p>Hows about an example?</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h4>Example</h4>
              <hr/>
              <p class='example'>You are a UX designer for a new hot app and wish to provide users with different skins (i.e., visual appearances) for your front-end. You notice from
                your beta data (heh that rhymed) that users seem to complain \(Y = 1\) or not \(Y = 0\) in different rates depending on the background art you decide to display, i.e.,
                based on your agent's decision \(D = \{A1, A2\}\). Still, though complaints are generally to be avoided (a utility score of 3), there is still feedback and information
                in each complaint (a utility score of 1). Moreover, the propensity to complain appears to be a consequence of both your chosen art on the interface, and the age of the
                user (discretized for simplicity as \(X = \{\text{young}, \text{old}\} = \{0, 1\} \). Based on this data, you model a Decision Network as follows:</p>
