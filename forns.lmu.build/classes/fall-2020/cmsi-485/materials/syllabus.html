              <p>CMSI 485 is a 3-Unit course providing the introductory theory behind, and practice implementing, a wide swath of solutions to problems in the domain of artificial
                intelligence. Students will not only be able to match problems to an appropriate approach, but will understand the history and development of past approaches that
                have led the research and industry to its current state.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
              <p>By the course's end, students will:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>be introduced to the many active areas of research in artificial intelligence, including: logical inference, probabilistic &amp; causal reasoning, fundamentals of data science, and
                  machine learning.</p></li>
                <li><p>understand existing approaches to a variety of classic and realistic AI problems, including those within: planning, reasoning under uncertainty, reasoning over time, classification, 
                  and select applications in deep learning.</p></li>
                <li><p>gain practice using popular data-structures in AI, including: propositional knowledgebases, search trees, planning graphs, Bayesian Networks, Naive Bayes 
                  Classifiers, decision trees, and artificial neural networks.</p></li>
                <li><p>become familiar with popular AI frameworks and libraries in Python (e.g., Numpy, Scikit, and PyTorch), and design artificial agents whose behaviors can be tangibly observed.</p></li>
                <li><p>grasp the ongoing avenues for research in the field, investigating some efforts that suit student-specific interests.</p></li>
              </ul>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
              <p class='debug'>Warning: before taking this course, it is assumed that you have a sufficient knowledge of the basics of the Python programming language.</p>
              <p>This class uses Python for its concrete examples, homework, and exams. We will not spend much class time reviewing Python fundamentals,
                though you are welcome to ask for clarification at any point.</p>
              <p>There is a <a href='https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su19/project0/#python-basics' target='_blank'>great Tutorial from Berkeley listed here</a>, the material of which you should be comfortable with.</p>
              <p>If you require additional practice, you may learn through any number of online tutorials, and test your skills on
                <a href="http://codingbat.com/python" target="_blank">codingbat.com</a> (for instance).</p>
              <br/>
              <p class='debug'>Additionally, you should be comfortable with the fundamentals of Git, and managing GitHub repositories.</p>
              <p>We will be using GitHub Classroom for assignment distribution and collection, so advance comfort with these tools will make your life easy.</p>
              <p>Need a refresher? Take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw" target="_blank">GitHub Tutorials here.</a></p>
              <p class='definition'>You will receive an invitation to our course's GitHub Classroom before the semester starts. Check your LMU Mail for this!</p>
                
              <br/>
              <h3>Texts</h3>
              <p>We will be using one textbook for the course, which will primarily cover the theoretical material: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597'>
                Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.) by Russell and Norvig.</a>. Although this specific text is not mandatory for the course, it contains all concepts that we will be covering in great detail, and your
                exams will expect that you understand these concepts.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I will provide <strong>abbreviated</strong> course notes for our lectures on my course page (see Notes tab)</p>
              <p>Resources will be provided throughout the course detailing any additional topics that are not sufficiently contained in the above text. These resources will be free and publicly available.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Lecture Attendance &amp; COVID-19</h3>
              <p class='definition'>Due to the dynamism required from *all* of us (students and faculty alike) during the time of COVID-19, this course will be hosted entirely online, though
                with synchronous lectures (in which you may attend and ask questions over Zoom) with asynchronous recordings for your review.</p>
              <p>Although not mandatory, lecture attendance is strongly advised since you'll otherwise miss out on all of our inside-jokes. Less importantly, you'll be missing out on lecture content that will not
                be posted online, classwork (see below), and hints for homework and exams. If you miss a lecture, the important points will be sketched in our course notes and a recording of the live session will be
                posted in the Notes tab.</p>
              <p>Lectures are participatory in nature, often with exercises and group-work to facilitate learning. Laptops are *discouraged* for note-taking, but *encouraged* for working on in-class problems.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Workload Expectations</h3>
              <p>As this is a 3-Unit class, it is expected that you will be allocating an average of 6 hours outside of lectures per week working on course assignments, reading, and studying. Some weeks will have less material
                to keep you busy, and others more, but be aware that this is a work-intensive course that may require you to spend a lot of time programming!</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Slack Messaging</h3>
              <p>Alongside email exchanges, you may reach me via the Slack messaging service (Slack is a chat client that can be
                <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>) in the LMUCS channel (lmucs.slack.com).</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Office Hours</h3>
              <p class='definition'>Due to COVID-19, there will be no in-person office hours, but I will be available to chat over Slack and Zoom at the following days and times:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>TR 2:30 - 5:30pm, via Slack or Zoom</p></li>
                <li><p>By appointment for other times (contact me via email or Slack)</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition to my office hours, this course has the following stellar TAs who are versed in its topics to assist (see LMU Slack / Discord for contact info):</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Lucille Njoo</p></li>

            <div id='schedule' class='scrollspy-element' scrollspy-title='Schedule'></div>
            <h1>Tentative Schedule of Topics</h1>
            <div>
              <p>The following constitutes the tentative schedule for topics to be covered in the course. This is largely an approximation for what we will cover each lecture, 
                and is subject to change. For each topic, the relevant chapter of the textbook is also given, however, you are only required to understand the sections of each chapter
                that correlate with the material in the course notes -- the rest are for your curiosity and edification!</p>

            <h1>Assignments &amp; Grading</h1>
            <div>
              <h3>Grade Decomposition</h3>
              <p>Grades will be assigned based on the following weighted coursework:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>[25%] Classwork:</strong> Small classwork assignments will be given throughout each week, with in-class time allocated for their completion. Though you will
                  have the opportunity to finish these in groups and with my assistance during class, you are not required to attend lectures, and so may submit these electronically by
                  their listed due dates. <i>Your lowest classwork grade will be dropped (even if you skipped it entirely).</i></p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>[45%] Homework:</strong> Larger assignments with heavy coding required. Programming style and comments are graded as well. All homework assignments are weighted equally.
                  Expect roughly 5 assignments in total, apportioned once every ~2.5 weeks.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>[30%] Exams:</strong> There will be 2 exams (a midterm and final). Your best exam score will constitute 2/3 of the exam grade, 
                  with your worse score constituting the remaining 1/3. For example, if your 2 exam scores were 60 and 90, then your weighted exam score for the course will be 80.0 (= 60*(1/3) + 90*(2/3))</p></li>
              </ul>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Final Grades</h3>
              <p>Final letter grades are given based on the university scale of grade percentages:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>A: 93 - 100</p></li>
                <li><p>A-: 90 - 92</p></li>
                <li><p>B+: 86 - 89</p></li>
                <li><p>B: 83 - 85</p></li>
                <li><p>B-: 80 - 82</p></li>
                <li><p>C+: 76 - 79</p></li>
                <li><p>C: 73 - 75</p></li>
                <li><p>C-: 70 - 72</p></li>
                <li><p>D: 65 - 69</p></li>
                <li><p>F: 64 and below</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Fractional grade percentages at 0.5 or over will be rounded up, so an 89.5% will be considered a 90% (A-), but an 89.4% will be considered an 89% (B+) on the above scale.</p>
              <p>That said, these are only the guaranteed grade assignments: if your "final" grade is an 82%, you are guaranteed a B- or better, but you might still get an A if 82% is the top score.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
              <p>Extra credit opportunities will be sporadically available during assignments / exams. If you receive all extra credit opportunities, you can gain a maximum +2% on your 
                final grade. These bonuses are applied post-difficulty-adjustments, so no student will be punished for not completing extra-credit relative to their peers.</p>
              
              <br/>
              <h3>Submission Standards</h3>
              <p>Each of your submitted homeworks and projects are subject to the following constraints:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Assignment posting:</strong> all assignments (classwork, homework, or otherwise) will be announced in class and posted on this site with due dates. You are responsible
                  for checking this site's Announcements and Brightspace for any updates to assignments and their associated deadlines.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Late Policy:</strong> assignments are due at exactly the time indicated by the method specified. Assignments that are late by anywhere from 0 - 24 hours will only receive
                  80% of the points that they would have otherwise earned. Assignments that are late by 24+ hours receive a 0. There are no exceptions to this rule.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Individual Work:</strong> students are encouraged to talk and think about problems in groups, but each submission should be their own, containing no code that has been
                  copy-pasted from another student. We take plagiarism very seriously, and each submission will be run through a similarity-checking mechanism to ensure fairness. Code or homework which
                  we believe to be shared innapropriately between students or copied from the internet is subject to severe disciplinary action (not that you would, just sayin'). The following are examples
                  of unacceptable behavior in this course:</p>
                  <ul class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p>Copying non-trivial amounts of code from the internet into an assignment (excluding small things from StackOverflow like how to do list comprehension or use itertools).</p></li>
                    <li><p>Copying another group's solutions on a classwork exercise (sharing between group members is encouraged... that's what it means to... you know... group up).</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If in doubt, ask!</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Style:</strong> assignments which are sloppily submitted without proper formatting, style, and comments are subject to penalties. As this is an upper-division
                  computer science class, you should be intimately familiar with these stylistic requirements.</p></li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Student Rights and Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>Just as I have certain expectations of you in this course, you may have certain expectations of me. Here is a high-level list of each:</p>
              <h4>My Responsibilities</h4>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Provide you with an educational experience superior to that which could be gleaned from a textbook or online source alone.</p></li>
                <li><p>Answer your questions and curiosities in office hours, over Slack, and via email with a turnaround of at most 36 hours.</p></li>
                <li><p>Give you feedback on your submissions and individualized instruction on how to maximize your gain from this class.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Your Responsibilities</h4>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Be responsible with use of your time, class time, office hours, email, and the Keck Lab TAs. Last minute pleas for help on assignments or exams are the opposite of this.</p></li>
                <li><p>Be respectful of classmates.</p></li>
                <li><p>Don't cheat or plagiarize on exams or assignments.</p></li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Tips for Success in this Class</h3>
              <p>Here are a few tips for succeeding in this class (and college, in general); they're not meant to sound patronizing, but rather, are simply pearls of wisdom to hand down from someone who
                 has recently trodden your path!</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Ask questions:</strong> if there is one piece of advice I can impart unto you, it's to ask questions when you have them. Chances are good that if you have a question, someone
                  else has the same one, you won't be left behind wondering about something that was covered minutes ago (and which future material might employ), and I promise not to judge you for whatever
                  you ask (well, not too hard at least). At the very least, if you have a question, write it down and then ask it after class. The
                  heart of academic inquiry is just that: inquiry!</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fear not the specter of error:</strong> in college classes, there tends to be a crippling aversion to being wrong, especially publicly! I'm here to tell you that there is no
                  better time to be wrong than in class, particularly in one as interactive as ours. There are a variety of silver-linings to being wrong: you won't forget what you were wrong about (one fewer
                  thing to cram for later), it's better to learn from being wrong when it doesn't matter (i.e., in discussion) than when it does (i.e., on a test or during an interview), and I will respect you
                  for your courage. There is only one circumstance in which you should fear error: when you fail to learn from it (at which point, see tip above for remedy).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Indulge your curiosity:</strong> and no, that's not some tagline stolen from a Vegas day-spa (actually, it might be, don't quote me on that), but the wisdom is sound... in class,
                  we will cover a variety of topics with accompanying exercises that highlight the main take-away messages of the lesson, but that does not mean that your learning should stop there. Indeed,
                  computer science is one of those beautiful disciplines wherein experimentation and exploration are so trivially entertained. Curious about what would happen if you changed the value of a
                  variable? Do it! Curious about what other methods exist for certain data types? Google them! There is no reason why your learning should be constrained to what I (strategically) offer you;
                  we have only limited time in class, and I'll prioritize the most important topics, but your interests can spread their own wings. Go forth and explore!</p></li>
