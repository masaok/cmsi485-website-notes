              <p class='definition'>This is a *group* assignment! Feel free to work in groups of up to 3 individuals.</p>
              <p>Having done such good work on Solicitorbot, you have been promoted to an advertising data scientist at Forney Industries, which is just about to launch
                its newest Home Automation / Defense line of robotics.</p>
              <p>The beta phase of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Killbot 3000</span> Defendotron 3001 is complete, and initial sales have been made to a variety of
                customers around the US.</p>
              <p>After each of these initial sales pitches (that ended in purchases or otherwise), Forney Industries collected demographic data on each participant, and quizzed them on
                a variety of metrics that were believed to be in some way related to the outcome of the sale.</p>
              <p>The launch of the Defendotron line is now upon us, and two customizable models are available for public consumption:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Defendotron Basic [$500]:</strong> comes with a siren and tazer to alert you and protect your home from intruders.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Defendotron 'Murica [$1,776]:</strong> comes with a full arsenal, including SAM missile array to protect from drone attack. Plays the Star Spangled 
                  Banner in place of siren when an intruder is detected.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              
              <h3>The Data</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p>Pending the launch of the Defendotron line, you are now analyzing the data collected by the in-person sales team in which a variety of traits and features must
                be integrated into an online advertising agent meant to select an ad that is most likely to be converted into a sale.</p>
              <p>In particular, before giving their pitch, the members of the sales team showed participants ads with two key variables:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Ad Video Choice [Ad1]:</strong> the video shows either a scare tactic of a home robbery (Ad1 = 0) or a patriotic montage with lots of guns and flags
                  waving (Ad1 = 1).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Ad Music Choice [Ad2]:</strong> the video either has a narrator's voice-over explaining the product (Ad2 = 0) or some tasteful classic rock
                  that mentions freedom a bunch (Ad2 = 1).</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>The sales team showed each of these ad combinations at random, then collected data on several important, binary features (described below) as well as 
                the *ternary* (3 values) outcome of the sales call:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><strong>Political Leaning [P]:</strong> the political leaning of the interviewee (0 = conservative, 1 = liberal)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Age Group [A]:</strong> generational age group of interviewee (0 = millennial, 1 = baby boomer+)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Position on Gun Control [G]:</strong> whether or not the interviewee is in support of stricter gun control legislation (0 = no, 1 = yes)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Possession of Home/Renter's Insurance [I]:</strong> whether or not the interviewee possesses home or renter's insurance (0 = no, 
                  1 = yes)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Perceived Threat of Crime [T]:</strong> whether or not the interviewee believes they live in a crime-filled neighborhood (0 = no, 1 = yes)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Perceived Threat of Foreign Invasion [F]:</strong> whether or not the interviewee believes in a foreign threat to the homeland (0 = no, 1 = yes)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Home Ownership [H]:</strong> whether or not the interviewee owns their home (0 = doesn't own, 1 = owns).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Sold Defendotron [S]:</strong> outcome of the sales pitch (0 = didn't buy anything, 1 = bought Defendotron 'Murica, 2 = bought Defendotron basic)</p></li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can find the dataset they collected from thousands of participants in the project skeleton.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <h3>Your Task</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p class='definition'>Your task: create a decision-network-based Ad Agent that will maximize Forney Industries' sales of Defendotrons online based on any of the
                user's collected demographic data on the metrics above. The agent must select the combination of Ad characteristics [Ad1, Ad2] that maximizes the expected
                utility of a sale.</p>
              <p>The problem: for each online sale, only some of these features may be known / observed, and so we need a means of deciding which ad combination to show
                them to maximize our expected sales.</p>
              <p>Specifically, you are tasked with the following:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Gain an understanding of the relationship between the variables collected by the sales team.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use this understanding to create an autonomous advertising agent.</p></li>
              </ul>
              <br/>
              
              <h3>Solution Skeleton</h3>

              <p>Start with the solution skeleton for this part in-hand! Segments left for you to do are indicated in comments:</p>

              <br/>
              
              <p>To address the goals above, we will familiarize ourselves with several popular probabilistic reasoning machine learning toolkits.</p>
              <p class='definition'>Throughout this process, you will be using some programmatic tools and some non-programmatic tools; when asked to record certain parts of the
                process, make additions to a Report file that you will submit as some sort of text / pdf document within a <code>doc</code> folder of your Github Classroom Repository.</p>

            <div id='modeling' class='scrollspy-element' scrollspy-title='Bayesian Network Modeling'></div>
            <h1>Bayesian Network Modeling</h1>
            <div>
              <p>Since we are starting this endeavor with only the dataset, our first task is to examine the putative <i>structure</i> of the BN using a bottom-up approach.</p>
              <p>This is not difficult to automate for some models, but in general, may require some companion human intervention. At the very least, it gives us and our greater
                marketing team some insights into what our customer-base looks like.</p>
              <p>However, when it comes to using Bayesian Networks to model <strong>causal</strong> relationships, the story is a bit trickier for a familiar reason:</p>
              <p class='definition'><strong>Observational equivalence:</strong> we may have independence relationships between variables that can be explained by
                different structures (e.g., \(X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y\) and \(X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y\) make the same independence claim that \(X \indep Y~|~Z\), but
                which is the "correct" causal story requires a human's assumptions since this is not a determination that can be made from the data alone).</p>
              <p>As such, we'll use a <i>structure learning</i> tool that can help us determine what parts of the BN structure can be learned from data and which require humans
                to set into place.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p>There are several popular tools for BN structure learning, but one of the most developed and used in academic settings is Tetrad, which you can find and 
                download below (just get the most recent version and download the associated *-launch.jar):</p>
              <p><a class='assignment' href='https://cloud.ccd.pitt.edu/nexus/content/repositories/releases/edu/cmu/tetrad-gui/6.7.1/' target='_blank'>Download Tetrad</a></p>
              <p>Tetrad is developed at CMU/Pitt and is useful in both probabilistic and causal structure discovery -- it does not provide tools for inference, which we will find
                elsewhere once we have determined the BN structure.</p>
              <p>What follows is a walkthrough for using Tetrad to determine the BN structure modeling the dataset given above.</p>
              <br/>
              
              <p class='problem'></p>
              <ol class='indent-1'>
                <li><p>Download the latest version of Tetrad (instructions above)</p></li>
                <li><p>Launch Tetrad (can just double click on the .jar file though Unix systems might need the terminal), after which you will be greeted with a new project window. Tetrad is modular, allowing you to make an analysis project that is comprised of
                  various linkable stages.</p></li>
                <li><p>Since we are interested in learning a network structure from data, go to the menu at the top and select <code>Pipelines -&gt; Search then Estimate</code>.
                  What appears is a pipeline that will find as much of the network structure as possible, have us decide on the final model, and then will estimate the network
                  parameters (CPTs). To do this, double click on each module in the following order, and perform the given steps:</p>
                  <ol class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p><strong>Data:</strong> load the dataset into Tetrad via <code>File -&gt; Load Data</code>, making sure to select "Discrete" data in the dialogue that pops up.
                      You should see all of the data in the table after this step.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Search:</strong> we'll now search for the network structure. In this module, you'll see that there are *many* structure learning algorithms
                      for a variety of scenarios.</p>
                      <ul class='indent-1'>
                        <li><p>In our case, we'll use the <code>PC Variants</code> method, which you shall select, then click "Set parameters" and finally
                          "Run and Generate Graph." (there's also a small snippet on the right with what it does -- neat!)</p></li>
                        <li><p>You'll notice that the structure is *almost* completely directed, except for some edges that are not. These are the edges that are not discernable
                          from the data alone and comprise the models in the observational equivalence class of the data.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p><strong>Graph:</strong> it's time for us to provide the direction of the edges that had an unknown orientation from the structure learning.</p>
                      <ul class='indent-1'>
                        <li><p>Select "Choose Dag in Pattern;" the edges that need to have an orientation chosen will be highlighted in yellow,
                          but you are given a "default" orientation that you (may) need to change.</p></li>
                        <li><p>From here, choose an edge direction for these ambiguous edges based on logical relationships of cause and effect. It should be
                          fairly obvious which direction the edges should point given the interpretations of the variables involved (though in general, you would need some sound,
                          scientific rationale for orienting an ambiguous edge in a particular direction).</p></li>
                        <li><p>The above step will require you use the edge tool (\(X \rightarrow Y\) in the menu) which you select and drag from cause to effect. You will also have
                          to select (by clicking on the edge [obnoxiously, the line, not the arrowhead]) and then delete (hitting the delete key) any suggested edges that you 
                          wanted to change.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Once you are satisfied (and have a proper DAG structure) hit the Done button.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p><strong>PM (Parameterized Model):</strong> just double click on this to verify the network structure, variable values, and expected CPTs.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Estimator:</strong> this module will list the network CPTs and parameters from the structure you learned / provided, plus the data from the
                      first step. (Note: display of the CPTs can be finnicky and it looks like some versions of Tetrad don't show them all -- don't worry, you'll be able to find
                      then using Pomegranate in a future step).</p>

                <ul class='indent-1'>
                  <li><p><code>Pomegranate</code>, a library for Bayesian Inference, which can be installed via the instructions listed on its GitHub page

              <h3>Important Documentation</h3>
              <hr/>
              <p>Once installed, head over to the Pomegranate tutorial on constructing a Bayesian Network, which should be fairly straightforward:</p>
              <p><a class='assignment' href='https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/BayesianNetwork.html' target='_blank'>Pomegranate BN Documentation</a></p>
              <p>For our purposes, you'll want to inspect several features of the interface:</p>
              <ul class='indent-1'>
                <li><p><code>BayesianNetwork.from_samples</code> to learn a network from a set of samples that we will provide. While we *could* fit the data to the structure
                  you found using Tetrad, we'll just let Pomegranate pick one model from the set of the observationally equivalent ones, which will deliver the same inferences
                  albeit have less intuitive causal structure.
                  You'll want to specify the following parameters:</p>
                  <ul class='indent-1'>
                    <li><p><code>X</code> the data to fit the structure to, which has to be read from the dataset you downloaded above. To read a dataset from a CSV,
                      you'll want to look into the <code>pandas</code> library's <code>read_csv</code> method. Providing this dataset populates the network parameters 
                      (learns the CPT values from the data).</p></li>
                    <li><p><code>state_names</code> a list of strings indicating the node names (the order of the columns in the data file, which can be read from it using
                      some handy pandas methods).</p></li>
                    <li><p><code>algorithm='exact'</code> set this named parameter in the BN constructor to give it maximal accuracy. It'll take a bit longer to construct, but will
                      make your work / debugging easier to check.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><code>predict_proba</code> parameterized by some evidence, returns a list of each node's CPTs updated by the given evidence. Consult the parameters
                  property of each CPT for the probability values. (Hint: it's easiest just to print out what this method returns and see how to use its components).</p>
                  <p class='debug'>NOTE: Tables listed are in the order of the <code>state_names</code> list you constructed the BN with, and represent \(P(V|e)\) for every variable
                    \(V\) and evidence \(e\) -- these are *not* the CPTs, but rather, the likelihood of each variable under the evidence.</p>
                  <p class='toolkit'>As such, it is recommended you make a small helper method in the AdAgent to extract the likelihood of any desired variable \(V\) from this
                    distribution format.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
